# NextShop CRM

Base Next.js 15 project configured with TypeScript, ESLint, and Tailwind CSS 4 for the NextShop CRM demo.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies (already completed if you pulled the repo) and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app. Edit `src/app/page.tsx` or add files under `src/app` to see live updates.

Global styles are defined in `src/app/globals.css`, which loads Tailwind's base, components, and utilities layers to accelerate UI work.
